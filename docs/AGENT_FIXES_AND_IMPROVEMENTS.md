# Agent Automation Fixes & Improvements

## Overview
This document details the critical fixes and improvements made to the AI agent automation system based on Claude 4.5 best practices and documentation.

## Critical Fixes

### 1. Tool Result Conversation Format (FIXED)
**Problem**: The agent was getting 400 errors from Claude API with message:
```
"tool_use_id found in tool_result blocks without corresponding tool_use block"
```

**Root Cause**: According to Claude's documentation, tool results must have corresponding tool_use blocks in the conversation history. Our implementation was adding standalone tool_result blocks without the proper tool_use context.

**Solution**: 
- Removed improper `addToolResult` calls during execution
- The plan execution is now self-contained and doesn't rely on conversation history with tool results
- For replanning, we start fresh with just the replan prompt instead of including malformed conversation history

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/automation/agent/AgentOrchestrator.ts`: Removed tool result addition to memory during execution
- `src/main/automation/agent/AgentOrchestrator.ts`: Fixed replan to not use conversation history with tool blocks

### 2. Improved Planning Prompts (ENHANCED)
**Problem**: Agent was generating generic, unreliable element selectors that failed frequently.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote planning system prompt based on Claude 4.5 best practices:

**Key Improvements**:
- **Text-based element finding**: Emphasized using visible text content (most reliable)
- **Explicit instructions**: Added detailed guidelines for each tool category
- **Element finding strategy**: Provided fallback approaches with priorities
- **Observation-first approach**: Mandated using observation tools before actions
- **Clear output format**: Specified exact JSON structure required
- **Verification steps**: Emphasized importance of checking action success

**Best Practices Applied** (from Claude 4.5 docs):
1. Be explicit with instructions ‚úì
2. Add context to improve performance ‚úì
3. Be vigilant with examples & details ‚úì
4. Provide structured formats ‚úì

### 3. Enhanced Browser Context Information (IMPROVED)
**Problem**: Agent had limited visibility into page elements, making it hard to find the right selectors.

**Solution**: Enhanced context extraction in prompts to include:
- Visible interactive elements from pruned DOM (up to 30 elements)
- Element text content, attributes (id, class, aria-label, href)
- CSS selectors for each element
- Accessible interactive elements from accessibility tree
- Clear formatting for easy parsing

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main/automation/agent/AgentOrchestrator.ts`: `buildPlanningUserPrompt()` method
- `src/main/automation/agent/AgentOrchestrator.ts`: `buildReplanPrompt()` method

## Implementation Details

### Critical Element Finding Strategy
The new prompt teaches Claude to:

1. **Primary**: Search by visible text content
   ```
   "button with text 'Create repository'"
   ```

2. **Secondary**: Use aria-label attributes
   ```
   "button with aria-label containing 'create' and 'repository'"
   ```

3. **Tertiary**: Use specific CSS selectors
   ```
   "button with class 'btn-primary'"
   ```

4. **Final fallback**: Generic selector with context
   ```
   "primary action button in main navigation"
   ```

### Planning Guidelines Enforced
1. **Use observation tools first** - Never guess about page structure
2. **Be specific with selectors** - Prefer text content over generic selectors
3. **Break down complex tasks** - Atomic, sequential steps
4. **Include wait steps** - Always wait for elements before interaction
5. **Add verification steps** - Confirm actions succeeded
6. **Handle failures gracefully** - Multiple fallback strategies
7. **Keep steps focused** - One clear action per step
8. **Provide clear reasoning** - Explain each step's purpose

### Execution Flow
```
1. User submits automation request with recorded session
   ‚Üì
2. Analyze recorded session for patterns
   ‚Üì
3. Get initial browser context (DOM + accessibility tree)
   ‚Üì
4. Generate execution plan with Claude (with enhanced context)
   ‚Üì
5. Execute plan step-by-step:
   - Get fresh browser context before each step
   - Execute tool via ToolRegistry
   - Wait for page stability
   - Record result in execution history
   ‚Üì
6. On failure:
   - Retry up to maxRetries (default: 3)
   - If max retries exceeded, trigger replan
   - Replan with fresh context and error details
   - Continue execution with new plan
   ‚Üì
7. Complete when all steps succeed or max iterations reached
```

## Configuration

### Agent Configuration (AgentConfig)
```typescript
{
  apiKey: string;           // Anthropic API key
  model?: string;           // Default: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514'
  maxIterations?: number;   // Default: 15
  maxRetries?: number;      // Default: 3
  temperature?: number;     // Default: 0.7
  thinkingBudget?: number;  // Default: 10000 (extended thinking tokens)
}
```

### Recommended Settings for Production
```typescript
const config = {
  model: 'claude-sonnet-4-20250514',
  maxIterations: 20,        // Allow more iterations for complex tasks
  maxRetries: 3,            // 3 retries per step
  temperature: 0.7,         // Good balance of creativity and consistency
  thinkingBudget: 10000     // Enable extended thinking
};
```

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Case: Create GitHub Repository
```typescript
const request = {
  userIntent: 'Create a new repository named test-repo',
  recordedSession: githubRecordingSession,
  constraints: ['Use public visibility'],
  expectedOutcome: 'Repository created successfully'
};

const result = await agentOrchestrator.executeAutomation(request);
```

### Expected Behavior (After Fixes):
1. ‚úì Agent navigates to GitHub
2. ‚úì Agent finds "New" or "Create repository" button using text content
3. ‚úì Agent clicks the button
4. ‚úì Agent fills in repository name
5. ‚úì Agent selects visibility
6. ‚úì Agent clicks "Create repository"
7. ‚úì Agent verifies success

### Previous Behavior (Before Fixes):
1. ‚úó Agent failed to find elements with generic descriptions
2. ‚úó Agent got 400 errors from improper tool result format
3. ‚úó Agent couldn't recover from failures properly

## Key Takeaways

### What Works Well Now:
- ‚úì Text-based element finding (most reliable)
- ‚úì Proper error handling and recovery
- ‚úì Rich browser context for better decision-making
- ‚úì Compliance with Claude API requirements
- ‚úì Self-debugging through replanning

### Best Practices for Users:
1. **Provide clear automation intents**: Be specific about what you want
2. **Use recorded sessions**: They provide valuable patterns
3. **Include constraints**: Help guide the agent's decisions
4. **Monitor execution**: Check logs for step-by-step progress
5. **Adjust configuration**: Tune maxIterations and maxRetries for your use case

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Enable Detailed Logging:
The agent logs each step:
```
üéØ Starting automation: [user intent]
üìä Analyzing recorded session...
üß† Generating execution plan...
üìã Plan generated with X steps
üîÑ ReAct Iteration 1/15
üìç Step 1: [tool_name]
‚úÖ Step 1 succeeded
```

### Check Execution History:
```typescript
const state = agentOrchestrator.getState();
console.log('Execution History:', state.executionHistory);
console.log('Errors:', state.errors);
console.log('Current Step:', state.currentStep);
```

### Common Issues & Solutions:

**Issue**: Element still not found
**Solution**: Check the pruned DOM output in logs. The element might have different text or attributes than expected.

**Issue**: Plan fails consistently at same step
**Solution**: The recorded session pattern might not match the current page. Try without a recorded session or update the recording.

**Issue**: Timeout errors
**Solution**: Increase wait times in ContextExtractionOptions or add explicit wait_for_element steps in the plan.
